## Detailed examples

### Additional Recommendations  

It is strongly recommended to read the main `README.md` file before proceeding.  

Similar to `manager.sh` and `helper_man.sh`, the pipeline can also be run using `overall.sh` as an alternative.  

This method is particularly useful when working with a list of ORCA output files that require the same parameters. For instance, this could apply to cases where the same molecule has multiple conformers.  

In most cases (though itâ€™s advisable to verify for your specific situation), the molecular orbitals (MOs) L&ouml;wdin population data is organized consistently across outputs. This consistency allows you to apply the same parameters (e.g., `core_MO_range`) across the list of ORCA outputs.  

**Important Note:**  
- Each individual ORCA output file in the list **must** include the L&ouml;wdin population calculation.
- Even with conformational variations of the same molecule, the target excited state (`exc_state_range`) for analysis might vary slightly between outputs.

### Assumptions  

If the required parameters for analyzing excited states and L&ouml;wdin population data remain consistent across a list of ORCA output files, you can use `overall.sh`. This script automatically executes `manager.sh` for each input file in the list.  

- **Using `overall.sh`**:  
  Ensure that the list of ORCA output files is not placed in the same directory as the scripts. As with `manager.sh`, no additional files should be present in the folder during execution.  

**Note:**
It is advisable to review the latest updates to `manager.sh` and `helper_man.sh` and, if necessary, incorporate or modify them in `overall.sh` to suit your specific preferences. 

- **Using `manager.sh`**:
Please refer to the updated details about `manager.sh` in the main `README.md` first, as the following information may be outdated.  
  Place the ORCA output file in the same directory as the scripts. Ensure that no other additional files are present in the folder during execution.

### Prerequisites for Running the Pipeline  

The required input for this pipeline is an XAS output file from ORCA, generated using either `ROCIS/DFT` or `PNO-ROCIS/DFT`.  

An example input file, `AB_4.0A.out`, is provided. This file was generated using `PNO-ROCIS/DFT` and includes the molecular orbital (MO) L&ouml;wdin population data.  




The pipeline is written in Shell script. It is recommendable to run it in linux SO.
You can run it either using `manager.sh` or `overall.sh`

If you are using `manager.sh`, the ORCA output can be placed in the same folder where all the scripts are placed.
But no other additional file should be there at the same time.

If you are using `overall.sh`, the list of ORCA outputs cannot be placed in the same folder where all the scripts are placed.
And no other additional file should be there at the same time.

### Prerequisites to run (inside the ORCA output)

The input required to run this pipeline is a XAS ouput from ORCA using `ROCIS/DFT` or `PNO-ROCIS/DFT`.
In this case, the input example is `AB_4.0A.out`.
The `AB_4.0A.out` file was done using `PNO-ROCIS/DFT`, it contains the molecular orbital (MO) L&ouml;wdin population

The L&ouml;wdin population looks as follows:

In the first group of six MOs are from the core space and the last two (in this example) belong to the virtual space.

In `AB_4.0A.out`, the XAS results has the folowing standard format of transitions by excited state with including the list of coupling MOs:

There are more format versions for presenting the excited states and the MO coupling transitions.
This pipeline just **accepts** the format presented below.

### Run

`manager.sh` is the main script that runs all the scripts following their evident sequential step names. 
The way of running is by typing:

     $ ./manager.sh $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8

where:

    `$1` and `$2` are the atom range (initial and final atom) that represents a first molecular region target in the whole protein or peptide calculation
    `$3` and `$4` are the atom range (initial and final atom) that represents a second molecular region target in the whole protein or peptide calculation
    `$5` and `$6` are the core MO range (initial and final MO) corresponding to C 1s (in the furute will be adapt to N, O and S)
    `$7` is the XAS ORCA output
    `$8` is the excited state range described by two numbers jount by the character '-'

Examples of this in the following part.

`overall.sh` is another script that you can use to start the pipeline, the only difference is that overall is intended for a list of ORCA outputs.
So in this case you will repeat the pipeline the same number of times as number of ORCA outputs you present.

The only condition to run using `overall.sh` is to save all the ORCA outputs in another folder.

     $ ./overall.sh $DIR

where:
     
     $DIR is the absolute path where the list of ORCA outputs are placed (only ORCA output files!)

### Examples:

1. `AB_4.0A.out` for S'=S (option `0`)
2. `AB_4.1A.out` for S'=S+1 and SOC evaluation (option `1`).


`AB_4.0A.out` is an ORCA output that represents a system of two amino acids, face-to-face oriented by the side aromatic chain.
Phenylalanine (F) and tyrosine (Y) pair has a stacking distance of 4.0\AA.

The F is in the atom range 0 to 22.
The Y in the atom range 23 to 46.
The core MOs for C 1s are in the range of 7 to 24.
The information presented in matricial form will be constructed using the excited-state information list in the output since the 
excited state 1 up to the excited state 17.

     $ ./manager.sh 0 22 23 46 7 24 AB_4.0A.out 1-17

If you want to take all the excited states from `AB_4.0A.out` then $8 should be called none:

     $ ./manager.sh 0 22 23 46 7 24 AB_4.0A.out none


`AB_4.1A.out` is the same ORCA calculation for a face-to-face oriented by the side aromatic chain like in `AB_4.0A.out`.
Even, the pair interaction has a stacking of 4.0\AA also.
The **only difference** is that calculation includes higher multiplicity and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) evaluation.

Due to calculation has two options: `0` for S'=S and `1` S'=S+1 and SOC evaluation.
I used the same name of file just changing the last number.
Then: `AB_4.0A.out` of option `0` S'=S and `AB_4.1A.out` of option `1` S'=S+1 and SOC evaluation.
